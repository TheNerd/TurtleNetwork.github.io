Non-fungible tokens:

A non-fungible token or NFT is a special type of a token, that represents some unique object.

Two regular tokens cannot be distinguished from each other â€” they are alike, i.e. fungible. Each NFT token is unique, and therefore NFTs are non-fungible. Any two NFTs can always be distinguished.

Every NFT has a unique ID.

NFTs are most commonly used in games.
